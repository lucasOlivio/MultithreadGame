# Multithreaded game

## About

Project for game algorithms and gems class. On this project we are supposed to create a simple 3D "game" just to demonstrate multi thread usage and the increase of performance that it provided.

## Requirements

- Visual studio 2022

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `Scripts/` directory and run the appropriate `Setup` script to generate projects files.
3. Open and run the solution.

To test the performance without the threads comment the lines 273 and 299 and then uncomment the lines 274 and 300 in Engine.cpp

## How to play

- W/A/S/D move the camera
- SPACE shoots the balls
